REQUIREMENTS
------------

        gtkmm and its dependencies
        
	curl / libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se - most probably included with
	your distribution)
        
	libmagic and its dependencies
        gettext / libintl

        of course you will need the *-dev packages for compiling!


INSTALLATION
------------

Execute ./configure --prefix=YOURPREFIX
setting YOURPREFIX to your preffered prefix (e.g. /usr or /usr/local .. )

In the extraction directory do:
        make

and then as root:   
        make install

this will install gimmage to /usr/local/bin/gimmage and the icons to
/usr/local/share/gimmage/icons (or the prefix you selected)

If you want to try gimmage out before installing, just run it from the
extraction directory:
        src/gimmage


DEBUGGING VERSION
-----------------

Further, for the debugging version:
        ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug
        make

and as root:
        make install

Note: the debugging version is slow and spouts out a lot of text.


UNINSTALLATION
--------------

to uninstall, do:

        make uninstall

in the extraction directory as root
