BUGS 
The filechooser selects random files after it has been hidden once when in a
gnome session. I believe this is a bug in the filechooser widget.

When not in a gnome session, making the filechooser select a file is
EXTREMELY slow (1-2 seconds?!), so progressing from one image to the next
takes absolute ages when the filechooser is open. This is not the case in
gnome mode where it remains quick.

	
TODO
-add print support!! (could use some help on this one)
-add "all files" filefilter to filechooser
-better zooming and rotation --> see below
-add image counter to titlebar

ImageEventBox rewrite

rewrite the EventBox as a drawing area and redraw only the currently visible bit for performance
reasons. Further, preload the next and previous images for speed. This will massively speed up image
loading time and any operations such as rotate and zoom. It will make drag scrolling a tiny bit
slower.
