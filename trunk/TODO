BUGS
-the filechooser breaks as follows:
	open a set of files (any way)
	press f to show filebrowser
	note that filechooser updates currently open file by selecting it
	close filechooser
	open filechooser
	filechooser will select random file and continue to do so
	
TODO
-add print support!! (could use some help on this one)
-add "all files" filefilter to filechooser
-better zooming and rotation
-add image counter to titlebar
