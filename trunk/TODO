ImageEventBox rewrite

rewrite the EventBox as a drawing area and redraw only the currently visible bit for performance
reasons. Further, preload the next and previous images for speed. This will massively speed up image
loading time and any operations such as rotate and zoom. It will make drag scrolling a tiny bit
slower.
