01.03.06 - 0.2.0
- It is no longer required to compile a LOCAL version to run gimmage
from the extraction directory, it now checks at run-time.
- Show busy cursor for image loading and rotation.
- Added support for internationalisation.
- First translations to German and French.

12.02.06 - 0.1.8
-Reversed orientation of zoom-in/zoom-out buttons following suggestion
by Scott Horrowitz.
-Changed the Makefile so that the "debug" version compiles without
additional CFLAGS on gentoo.
-Stop using /dev/null when there is no file to load and don't confuse the
user with an error-like message, just show a blank screen.
-Give error message only when a file was recognized to
be an image but fails to load.
-Give visual feedback to keypresses (ie: activate corresponding buttons)
-Attempt at preventing crash when gimmage is not in user's $PATH.
-Pressing escape quits gimmage.

07.02.06 - 0.1.7
-The user can now doubleclick files in the filechooser to open them.
-When opening ONE file that is already in the file-buffer, just select
that file rather than rescanning its directory. When the one file passed
to the file opener is a directory, skip checking whether it is in the 
current file buffer.
-Added keyboard shortcuts for save, rotate, open filebrowser and zoom
to original size.

06.02.06 - 0.1.6
-Removed dependancy on gnomevfs, we now use /usr/include/curl/curl.h
 --> added dependency on curl, which is more widespread
-Thanks to a nudge from Jaap Karssenberg we now have a real makefile!
-As a result, the program can be installed in any prefix without
crashing at startup.

06.02.06 - 0.1.5
-All instances of std::string replaced with Glib::ustring in
in preperation for proper internationalisation.
-Fix a segfault when only one image was loaded and the spacebar
was pressed.
-Prevent gimmage from attempting to open EPS files. They sometimes
include a TIFF section and the program was erroneously recognising
them as TIFF images.

04.02.06 - 0.1.4a
-When /dev/null is openened for lack of a file, set the filechooser
folder to the home directory rather than the fileystem root.
-When no image is loaded at first and the user subsequently loads a
directory using the filechooser, don't forget to turn the buttons
on!

01.02.06 - 0.1.4
-When the user opens ONE image, the directory of that
image is scanned for others.
-The filebrowser now opens the directory of the current image,
unless the file given was specified using a relative path.
-The current file is selected in the filebrowser, unless
the file was specified using a relative path.
