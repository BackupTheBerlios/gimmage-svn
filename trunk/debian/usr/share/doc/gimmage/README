--------------------------------
GIMMAGE - THE GTKMM IMAGE VIEWER
--------------------------------

If you happen to create a binary package of this software I would be very
happy if you could send it to me so that I could distribute it. Thank you
very much!


REQUIREMENTS
------------ 	
	gtkmm and its dependencies
	curl / libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se - most probably included with your distribution)
	libmagic and its dependencies
	gettext / libintl
	
	of course you will need the *-dev packages for compiling!


INSTALLATION
------------

Edit the Makefile to your requirements, by default, PREFIX is set to 
/usr/local

In the extraction directory do:
	make

and then as root:
	make install

this will install gimmage to /usr/local/bin/gimmage and the icons to
/usr/local/share/gimmage/icons (or the prefix you selected)

If you want to try gimmage out before installing, just run it from the
extraction directory:
	./gimmage

Further, for the debugging version:
	make debug

and as root:
	make install-debug

which will install gimmage-debug into /$PREFIX/bin


UNINSTALLATION
--------------

to uninstall, do:

	make uninstall

in the extraction directory as root

to uninstall the debugging executable do:
	
	make uninstall-debug

as root (note, uninstall-debug does not delete the icons in 
/$PREFIX/share/gimmage as you could still have the non-debug version
installed)


USERGUIDE
---------

when you start gimmage with * as an argument it will scan the current 
working directory and all subdirectories to one level and try to display 
all files therein (if they appear to be supported images)

starting gimmage with a directory as its argument will make it enter the
directory and scan it for diplayable images

in your filemanager you can configure gimmage to be an application with
which to open image files and/or directories

by clicking the "Show File Browser" button on the right you can select and
drag directories and images into the image display area to have them opened
and displayed. Single images can also be double-clicked, which will cause
the directory current directory to be searched for other images and the
currently selected image to be displayed.


have fun!
