gimmage (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

        * Fix configuration file managment.
        * It is no longer required to compile a LOCAL version to run gimmage
          from the extraction directory, it now checks at run-time.
        * Correctly load images that are not given with their full path
          (resolve full path name upon loading)
        * Show busy cursor for image loading and rotation.
        * Added support for internationalisation.
        * First translations to German and French. (very bad ones)
        * Some changes to the internal filemanager to produce very slight
          speedups. ( Reduce number of calls to iterator.end() and
          iterator.begin() )
        * Other changes to filemanager to skip magic file detection of the
          filename
          indicates an image format. It is much faster, but can result in
          false
          positives.
        * When the user presses and holds the spacebar or backspace allow
          the images
          to be displayed in full by flushing the drawing queue before
          proceeding
          to the next image.
        * Drag scrolling now works propery thanks to changes by Ramax Lo.
        * Various cleanups.
        * Complete autotools integration.
